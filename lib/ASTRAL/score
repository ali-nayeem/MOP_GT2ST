0 trees have missing taxa
Using tree-based weight calculation.
Using polytree-based weight calculation.
Polytree max score: 3
Polytree building time: 0.002 seconds.
Number of quartet trees in the gene trees: 3
You may want to ignore posterior probabilities and other statistics related to the following branch branch because the effective number of genes impacting it is only 3:
